# fastq files:


***FASTQ files are commonly used in bioinformatics to store nucleotide sequences along with their corresponding quality scores. Each record in a FASTQ file typically consists of four lines:***

```css
1. @SEQ_ID_1 
2. AGCTTGAC
3. +
4.!''*((((***
```

1. Sequence Identifier: Begins with an "@" symbol and is followed by an identifier.
2. Raw Sequence: The nucleotide sequence (A, T, C, G, or N).
3. separator Line: Begins with a "+" symbol, often followed by the same identifier as in the first line, though this is not always required.
   
4. Quality Scores: Encoded quality scores for each nucleotide in the sequence, often using ASCII characters to represent different Phred quality scores.
## FASTQ files are widely used in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies and are essential for storing and analyzing large volumes of sequencing data.
