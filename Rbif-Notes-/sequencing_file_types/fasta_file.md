# Fasta files are used for storing neucleotides or peptide sequencing. The format is a text based it contains ```header``` and a ```sequence```

```Header Line```: Each sequence entry starts with a header line that begins with a >. This line often contains a description or identifier for the sequence.

```Sequence Lines```: after the header line the sequence itself is presented in upper case letter. 

***here is an example***
```shell
>Sequence_1
ATGCGTACGTAGCTAGCTAG
TAGCTGATCGATCGTAGCT
>Sequence_2
GCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTA
GATCGTAGCTAGCTAGCTAG

```
